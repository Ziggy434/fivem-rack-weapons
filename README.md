# fivem-rack-weapons
A script to allow players in LEO / Emergency vehicles to "unrack" / "rack" a carbine rifle or pump shotgun using a simple command

(Plus all of the code is super simple to edit if you have any experience in LUA or any language for that matter :D)
Made by Ziggy (Ziggy\`#8842).

Please note that the PlayCustomSounds script is required as it is a dependancy. If you already have this script in your server however, just add the "unrack.ogg" file to the corresponding location in your resource.
